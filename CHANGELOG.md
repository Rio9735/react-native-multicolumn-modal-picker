# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-22

### Highlights

- Standardized API names with full TypeScript support and backward-compatible deprecated aliases.
- Added built-in localized defaults, custom themes, flexible styling options, and a native-driver modal overlay.
- Added `react-native-safe-area-context` as a peer dependency for safe-area layout handling.

### Added

- Exported TypeScript types and helper definitions for the public picker API.
- Built-in UI text translations via the `locale` prop for 29 supported languages, including automatic device detection for Norwegian Nynorsk (`nn`) normalized to `nb`.
- A centralized theming model built around `theme` and `customColorScheme` for clean palette configuration.
- Added the `overlay` palette color for customizing the modal backdrop.
- New, clearer prop names including `actionButtonsPosition`, `enableSearch`, `horizontalPadding`, `itemStyle`, `onValueChange`, `selectedValues`, `columns`, and `theme`.
- Explicit text props (`acceptButtonText`, `cancelButtonText`, `searchPlaceholder`) now take precedence over localized defaults.
- Added optional `onSearchFocus` and `onSearchBlur` callbacks for single-column search interactions.
- Added configurable border-radius properties for the modal, search bar, search clear button, and action buttons (all defaulting to `10`).
- Kept the selected-value highlight inactive for now; its compatibility props remain available but have no visible effect.

### Changed

- Preserved backward compatibility for legacy aliases while introducing the new theming and localization API.
- Updated documentation and reference examples for multi-column pickers and theme-aware search flows.
- Optimized package distribution with React Native-aware exports and generated CommonJS outputs.
- Updated peer dependencies to include `react-native-safe-area-context`.
- Improved search reliability with case- and accent-insensitive matching and proper selection state restoration.
- Refined multi-column rendering and fixed lifecycle callback order for cancellation actions.

### Deprecated

The following props still work for compatibility, but they were deprecated in `1.1.0` and will be removed in a future major version:

- `actionButtons` -> `actionButtonsPosition`
- `bgColor` -> `customColorScheme`
- `cancelButtonBgColor` -> legacy override for cancel button background; use `theme` + `customColorScheme` instead
- `actionButtonsBorderColor` -> `customColorScheme`
- `searchElementsColor` -> `customColorScheme`
- `selectionHighlightColor` -> retained for compatibility (currently inactive)
- `hPadding` -> `horizontalPadding`
- `searchBar` -> `enableSearch`
- `onValueChange1`, `onValueChange2`, `onValueChange3` -> `onValueChange`
- `onValuesChange` -> `onValueChange`

### Removed

- Removed the runtime `prop-types` dependency in favor of native TypeScript definitions.

### Migration note

Legacy aliases from 1.0.x remain supported as deprecated compatibility shims. New projects should use the current prop names, explicit text overrides for custom localizations, and `theme` + `customColorScheme` for styling. See the [README](https://github.com/Rio9735/react-native-multicolumn-modal-picker/blob/main/README.md) for migration details.

## [1.0.9] - 2023-11-07

### Changes (1.0.9)

- Adjustments were made to improve compatibility and performance.

### Notes (1.0.9)

- Documentation was improved.

## [1.0.8] - 2023-11-04

### Added (1.0.8)

- Added `postinstall` script to automatically install the peer dependency `@react-native-picker/picker` using `npm`, `expo`, or `yarn`, depending on the package manager the user is using to install `react-native-multicolumn-modal-picker`.

### Notes (1.0.8)

- Documentation was improved.

## [1.0.7] - 2023-10-30

### Changes (1.0.7)

- The dependency `@react-native-picker/picker` has been moved to peerDependencies to enhance the flexibility of the package, allowing compatibility with any version of `@react-native-picker/picker`. This gives users greater control over dependency versions. Additionally, if `npm v7` or higher is used, `@react-native-picker/picker` will automatically install if it is not present in the project, simplifying dependency management.

- Documentation was improved.

## [1.0.6] - 2023-10-26

### Notes (1.0.6)

- Significant bug from version `1.0.5` has been fixed.

## [1.0.5] - 2023-10-26

### Changes (1.0.5)

- Performance adjustments and minor corrections.

### Added (1.0.5)

- New property `actionButtons` has been added. This property controls both the visibility and the position of the “Accept” and “Cancel” action buttons. It supports several values including `"none"`, `"cancel"`, `"top"`, and `"bottom"`. For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/Rio9735/react-native-multicolumn-modal-picker/blob/main/README.md).
- New property `actionButtonsBorderColor` has been added. This property allows you to set the border color of the action buttons.
- `prop-types` dependency for runtime prop type validation, enhancing error detection and code quality. It also eases component implementation by providing autocomplete with a brief description of each prop and its data type.

### Modified (1.0.5)

- The property name `extraView` has been changed to `hPadding` for improved clarity and consistency in property naming.
- Property `searchPlaceholderTextColor` has been changed to `searchElementsColor`. The new property `searchElementsColor`, in addition to defining the color of the search bar placeholder, also defines the color of the clear button in the search bar.
- Improved the performance of the search bar focus and blur animations in the selector by using the native driver. This change provides a smoother animation experience.

### Removed (1.0.5)

- The `showActionButtons` and `showCancelButton` properties have been removed. The functionality of these properties has been absorbed by the new `actionButtons` property.

### Package Experience Enhancements (1.0.5)

- New `postinstall` message in `package.json`.
- New “Do you like our package?” section in the documentation.
- Changelog is now located in `CHANGELOG.md` and referenced in the package documentation.

### Notes (1.0.5)

These changes provide more flexibility in controlling the visibility and position of the action buttons, making it easier to customize the user interface according to your needs.
